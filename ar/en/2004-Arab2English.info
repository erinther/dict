	"description": "Arab to German Glossary. A preliminary version aimed at reading Arab Webpages such as www.aljazeera.net. It is compiled from publicly available sources. Many words are still missing and I have a lot to work on incorporating Arab grammar (especially verb forms and plurals). The Arab2English glossary has been tested to work with the Webbrowsers Mozilla, Firebird and Opera. This glossary does not work well with Microsoft Internet Explorer and other Microsoft Software such as Microsoft Word. This is neither my fault nor that of Babylon, I think. But to the best of my knowledge the Arab language routines used by Microsoft are faulty. Keep updating. I'll appreciate your feedback to jofeu@web.de",
